# BJCP Beer Style Guidelines

This package provides a JSON version of the [Beer Judge Certification Program](https://www.bjcp.org) style guidelines.

### 2015 Guidelines

Content is based on [official XML version](https://github.com/meanphil/bjcp-guidelines-2015).

### 2021 Guidelines

JSON version was build by parsing [official docx version](https://www.bjcp.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2021_Guidelines_Beer.docx).  
Currently, only beer guidelines are available.

Some adaptation were necessary to allow a normalized data structure :

- **Category 27 - Historical Beer**  
  Provided styles have no code.  
  A code was generated by adding an incremented letter to category's code (27A, 27B, ...), keeping the document order.
- **Style 21B - Specialty IPA**  
  Although referenced as a style, it looks more like a category and contains different sub-styles with no code.  
  Sub-styles were parsed as regular styles with a code generated by adding an incremented letter to parent style's code (21Ba, 21Bb, ...), keeping the document order.  
  A `parentStyleId` key was also added to track hierarchical relation.
- **Vital Statistics** cannot always be parsed :
    - **Statistics match standard format but contain comments.**  
      Affected style : 23F  
      Comment was removed to allow standard parsing.  
      Original expression was appended to style description.
    - **Statistics match standard format but contain multiple values for some data.**  
      Affected style : 25B  
      When multiple data, extremum were kept.  
      Original statistics expression was appended to style description.
    - **Statistics don't match standard format.**  
      Affected styles : 21B, 27A, 28A, 28B, 28C, 29A, 29B, 29C, 30A, 30B, 30C, 30D, 31A, 31B, 32A, 32B, 34A, 34B, 34C  
      Nothing was parsed.  
      Original statistics expression was appended to style description.
